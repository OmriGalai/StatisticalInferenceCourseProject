```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```
First let's simulate 1000 draws of 40 exponential random variables and store them in a data frame.
```{r}
n = 40
nosim = 1000
sim <- data.frame()
sim <- sapply(1:nosim, function(i) sim <- rbind(sim, rexp(40, 0.2)))
```
Now let's take a look at the dimensions of the data frame:
```{r}
dim(sim)
```
Central limit theorem posits that the mean of sample averages approximates the population mean (1/lambda = 5, same as population sd) and its standard error should be sigma/sqrt(n):
```{r}
apply(sim, 1, mean)
apply(sim, 1, sd)
print(1/0.2/sqrt(40))
```
As expected the simulation statistics are very close to computed values.
